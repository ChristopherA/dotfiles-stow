# Install all macOS updates, reboot if necessary, and install command line tools

# 2016-09-21 Confirmed working with macOS Sierra 10.12.0

# Execute on a new machine via:

# $ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChristopherA/dotfiles/master/install/allosxupdates.sh | bash

# TBD: It is possible that after command line utilities are installed that
# additional updates may be required, even though previous test resulted in
# a report of no updates required. For now I'm forcing one last update. To
# to do properly requires refactoring this script and how it does update checks,
# probably some form of 'until [ $found_updates -eq 0 ] do xxxx done'

# TBD: There should be some way if a restart is required to install a
# script to automatically start this script again, until found_updates() is
# false. I've had too many false starts on this for it to be a priority.

# TBD: Redo all the echos and command output to /dev/null
# if $SCRIPT_DEBUG is false.
